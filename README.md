# FOMO Arbitrage Aggregator Bot

## Gimme the loot

A zero-fluff, **multi-program arbitrage aggregator bot** on Solana. **Powered by Loot**, our based signal engine that sniffs out the ***earliest breakouts*** and ***the most likely-to-print routes*** before the herd shows up. Spitting out action-ready bundles of hot mints, the exact pools to hit, ALUTs ready to plug, and dialed priority fees — so you can route, send, and land faster. It’s built for degens who care about one thing: **landing profitable wins first** — fewer dead ends, less noise, no cope.

**FOMO** is the execution layer — lightweight, stupid fast, and built to ship wins, not babysit configs. Under the hood it plugs into proven on-chain programs (SolanaMevBot + NotArb), but the flex is yours: pick the program you want, or dual-send to both simultaneously. No MEV-science-fair setup, no 40-tab tuning session — configure once, hit start, and let it spam the edge.

Easy config. No MEV bot-specific nonsense. Hassle-free, fast setup.
